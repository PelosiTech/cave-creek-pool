            <h2>How We Got Started</h2>
            <p>Cave Creek Pool Pros started in 2013 when Mike Castillo decided he'd had enough of corporate America. After spending 15 years in facilities management — including overseeing aquatic centers in Southern California — Mike moved his family to Cave Creek for the slower pace and open desert skies.</p>
            <p>He quickly noticed something: most pool companies in the area were stretched thin, covering massive territories from Scottsdale to Anthem. Service suffered. Pools got neglected. Homeowners got frustrated. Mike figured he could do better by doing less — focusing on a smaller area and doing the job right.</p>
            <p>He was right. Starting with just 15 residential clients in Cave Creek and Carefree, the business grew entirely by word of mouth. Today, Cave Creek Pool Pros maintains over 180 pools across the area, and Mike still personally services accounts every week.</p>

            <h2>Our Approach</h2>
            <p>We keep things simple. We show up when we say we will. We clean your pool thoroughly. We keep your chemistry dialed in. And we charge a fair price for it. No upselling, no scare tactics, no 12-month contracts you can't get out of.</p>
            <p>Every pool gets the same attention whether it's a small plunge pool behind a townhome or a 40,000-gallon resort-style pool on a custom property. That's just how we operate.</p>

            <h2>Desert Pool Expertise</h2>
            <p>Cave Creek and the Sonoran Desert present unique challenges for pool care. Extreme heat accelerates chemical consumption. Dust storms dump debris overnight. Hard water causes calcium scaling on tile and equipment. Monsoon rains can turn a pool green in 48 hours.</p>
            <p>We've spent over a decade learning these patterns and adapting our service to handle them. Our chemical protocols change with the seasons, and our technicians are trained to spot problems before they become expensive.</p>
