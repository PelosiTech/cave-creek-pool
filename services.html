            <h2>Weekly Pool Maintenance</h2>
            <p>Keeping a pool clean in Cave Creek means battling dust, hard water, and Arizona's relentless sun. Our weekly service is designed specifically for these challenges. Each visit includes a thorough cleaning, chemical balance check, and equipment inspection.</p>
            <p>We monitor your water chemistry closely, adjusting for seasonal changes — heavier chlorine demand in summer, calcium management in winter. You'll get a clean, safe pool every single week without lifting a finger.</p>
            <p><strong>Every visit includes:</strong> Surface and bottom debris removal, tile line brushing, basket emptying, chemical testing and adjustment, filter pressure monitoring, equipment visual inspection.</p>

            <h2>Green Pool Recovery</h2>
            <p>Vacant home? Missed a few weeks? Monsoon season aftermath? We see it all in Cave Creek. Our green-to-clean service restores even the worst pools to swimming condition within days.</p>
            <p>We start with aggressive shock treatment and manual brushing, clean or replace filters as needed, and bring the chemistry back into perfect balance. We've cleaned pools that other companies walked away from.</p>

    <section class="service-block" id="repair">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Equipment Repair</h2>
            <p>Pool equipment doesn't last forever — especially in Arizona heat. When your pump, filter, heater, or chlorinator breaks down, we respond fast. Most common repairs are completed the same day.</p>
            <p><strong>We repair &amp; service:</strong> Pool pumps (single, dual, variable-speed), cartridge and DE filters, gas and heat pump pool heaters, chlorine generators, pool lights, timers and automation, plumbing leaks and valves.</p>

    <section class="service-block" id="upgrades">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Equipment Upgrades &amp; Installation</h2>
            <p>Ready to upgrade to a variable-speed pump and cut your energy bill in half? Want a salt chlorine generator for softer, more pleasant water? Looking to add automation so you can control your pool from your phone?</p>
            <p>We install all major brands including Pentair, Hayward, and Jandy. We'll assess your current setup, recommend the best options for your pool size and budget, and handle the entire installation professionally.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <h2>Filter Cleaning</h2>
            <p>Cave Creek's dusty conditions mean your filter works overtime. Regular filter cleaning — we recommend every 3 months — keeps your water clear and your equipment running efficiently. We service cartridge, DE, and sand filters for pools of all sizes.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <h2>Salt System Service</h2>
            <p>Salt chlorine generators are an excellent fit for Cave Creek pools. They produce consistent, gentle chlorination without the hassle of buying and handling chemicals. We install new salt systems, service existing ones, and replace worn-out salt cells.</p>
